## TODOs
- Documentation!
- Host-agnostic test suites, for ensuring both ImageHosts return the same kinds of data.
- Configuration values for maximum image dimensions (i.e. resizing images when uploading).
- Moderated image support for LocalImageHost: perhaps using the same method as maintaining tags.
